This project was made to learn more about ML and tensorflow. The final twitter
bot can be found @bot_rogan on twitter. (hopefully)!

Made by Ekim Karabey, @Ekimerton on Github and most places.

## Specifics
* Character generating RNN
* Built using Tensorflow & Keras on Google Colab
* Trained using auto-generated captions of the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast
* The webapp boilerplate is there so heroku doesn't freak out
